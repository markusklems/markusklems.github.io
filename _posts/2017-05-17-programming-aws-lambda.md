Amazon Lambda is the part of Amazon Web Services that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. Amazon Lambda is a compute service that enables you to deploy applications and back-end services that operate with zero upfront cost and require no system administration.

In a [video tutorial][packt] that I created and which is distributed by Pack Publishing, I show the basics of Amazon Lambda and walk you through combining Lambda with other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon API Gateway Service, Amazon DynamoDB, and so on. Moving on, the tutorial shows you how to write, run, and test Lambda functions using Node.js, Java, Python, and C#. Moreover, you will learn how to use its serverless framework to increase your development productivity.

You can find the source code for the exercises that accompany the tutorial in my [programming-aws-lambda repo][aws-lambda-gh].
