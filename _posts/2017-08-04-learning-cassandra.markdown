Over the years, I have worked a lot with Cassandra on different infrastructure setups and occasionally provide in-house workshops or workshops at the Linuxhotel.

If you are interested in learning about the Cassandra NoSQL database, I have recently dockerized and published most of my workshop exercises to the [learning-cassandra github repo][cassandra-gh].

Here is a slidesets from my workshops: [Cassandra - Background and Architecture (PDF)][cassandra-background]
